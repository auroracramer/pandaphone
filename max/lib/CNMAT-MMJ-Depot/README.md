CNMAT-MMJ-Depot
===============

CNMAT's expanding library of Max/MSP/Jitter patches and supporting files designed for composers, programmers, performers and music educators. The library, although not exclusively written in Max/MSP/Jitter format (.maxpat and .maxhelp), is meant to be utilized by the Max/MSP/Jitter dataflow language.  The MMJ-Depot includes basic programming tips, modular programming units for copy and paste, interactive tutorials on all aspects of computer music, and functioning musical works with commentary and criticism.
